# Cahuilla-Morphological-Parser

This parser takes in a Cahuilla noun and extracts the morphological components and their glosses. Because Cahuilla is an agglutinative language, some nouns can be comprised of many smaller components. This is a toy parser that focuses on nominalizer nouns. These nouns have a root verb base and have one or more nominalizers affixed to the root verb that change the meaning to some sort of abstract or concrete noun. This parser will extract the root verb and separate the remaining word into the nominalizers and each of their meanings. 

To run this code, clone the repository and run in Pycharm or your preferred IDE.
